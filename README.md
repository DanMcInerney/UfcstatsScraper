# UfcstatsScraper

Scrapes Ufcstats.com for fight data.

## Description

Scrapes ufcstats.com for data. This is based on https://github.com/swang2016/ufc_scraper and customized for my own purposes. I do not want this to reflect how I would've written this from scratch as a clean, asynchrous, possibly scrapy library but I don't have the time or willpower to rewrite it. I do not intend to support this package for others. I will accept useful pull requests, however.
